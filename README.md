The most dangerous place to work nowadays is mines, as working there is extremely unsafe due to hazardous conditions. A microcontroller-based circuit is fitted in the mining worker safety helmet which tracks the environment of the mining site and evaluates the safety parameters. Also, the RF-based tracking system in the helmet helps in transferring data through the IoT network. The worker’s current location is detected in real-time while they are working at the mining site. In case of emergency, the helmet can be equipped with a panic button to create an alert to the management, and rescue operations can begin immediately shared over IoT’s web interface.
